NBA Data Mining Using Scrapy. The goal of this project is to use Scrapy to get scrape web data and build a MySQL database of NBA records for future use. 
Some quick analysis in Jupyter Notebook was also done but that was not the main motifs of this project.

## Data

All data sources

## Analysis

Analysis was done using [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/thanhn1756/-UROP-Employment-Pathway/tree/master/Python%20notebooks). 

#### Notebook Contents

Demographic data: [AgesandWages.ipynb](https://github.com/thanhn1756/-UROP-Employment-Pathway/blob/master/Python%20notebooks/Ages%20and%20Wages.ipynb)

Career Changer Matrix Modifications: [CareerChangerReplication.ipynb](https://github.com/thanhn1756/-UROP-Employment-Pathway/blob/master/Python%20notebooks/Career%20Changer%20Replication.ipynb)

Comparison of Skills: [SkillTransitions.ipynb](https://github.com/thanhn1756/-UROP-Employment-Pathway/blob/master/Python%20notebooks/Skill%20Transitions.ipynb)

Other Notebooks: Random stuff and descriptive statistics are contained in other Notebooks...feel free to poke around, I guess. 

### Packages used:

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html): Pandas Dataframe objects were used to manipulate data for visualization and analysis  

#### Main Visualization tools:

The main visualization tools used were [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html). In most cases, Plotly was prefered for its interactivity with data. However, matplotlib was used when Plotly's documentation was actually too trash to use or quick anaylsis was favored over interactivity.


### Questions/Comments/Concerns:

(Yes, I know that some of the code are not the cleanest but it works for the time being)
